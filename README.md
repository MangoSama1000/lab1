# 🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
# I was able to utilise CSS flexbox to create a resposnive nav bar.
# Also, being able to use url tags in css to imput images onto my website.
# Impleteing a CS absolute positioning to ensure the text overlays ontop of the image.
# 🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
# I didn't put haeder tag due to me running out of time and not seeing it but I was able to put a nav and footer bar in my html.
# 🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
# Trying to add a 3rd image / page into my code. Whenever I tried it would put the 3rd image in the middle of my previous pages causing a headache and after trying to search the interent I was unsucessful.
# Also the formatting could've been slightly better but I was on a time crunch due which is unfortunate.
